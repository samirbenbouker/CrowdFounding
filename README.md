# Crowdfunding DApp with Ethereum

## Overview

This project is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create and contribute to fundraising campaigns using Ether (ETH). The project consists of smart contracts written in Solidity for managing campaign logic and a frontend interface developed with React for user interaction.

## Features

- **Create Campaigns**: Users can create fundraising campaigns by specifying details such as the goal amount, deadline, and campaign title.
- **Contribute Funds**: Contributors can donate Ether to existing campaigns and track the progress towards the funding goal.
- **Campaign Management**: Campaign creators have the ability to manage their campaigns, including withdrawing funds, closing campaigns, and updating campaign details.
- **Transparency and Security**: All transactions and contributions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, providing transparency and security to both campaign creators and contributors.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Used for writing smart contracts that define the logic of the crowdfunding platform.
- **React**: Used for building the frontend user interface, allowing users to interact with the crowdfunding platform.
- **Web3.js**: Used for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts from the frontend, enabling seamless integration with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Hardhat**: Used for local development, testing, and deployment of Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Metamask**: A browser extension wallet used for connecting to the Ethereum blockchain and interacting with decentralized applications (DApps) like this crowdfunding platform.
